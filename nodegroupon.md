# node at groupon

Problems:

- had a huge monolithic rails app
- Acquired a bunch of similar businesses across the world
- Two separate stacks b/w US and Europe/Asia
- Mobile ecommerce took off, so they built out a API layer on each stack

so launching features took forever

... and they did it, and broke a bunch of stuff in the process, and fixed it
