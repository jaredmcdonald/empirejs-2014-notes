# web components

What are web components?

Declare domain-specific HTML tags, with behavior defined by javascript.

## What components are not

don't help you answer the questions of:

- where you're getting your data from
- application state

Instead, they create reusable ways of displaying said states to users.

They still need to be integrated in an application architecture.

## Benefits of components

- reusable
- isolated
- use html
- reduce development time

extensible web: [http://extensiblewebmanifesto.org]()

any feature in the browser should be implementable with javascript

- bridge ecosystems
- interoperability
