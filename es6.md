The future of web apps

1. you visit a url

2. sometimes, you bookmark a url

That's it... no app store, etc.


## How do we get there?

- user engagement

  webapps are currently deficient for a couple reasons:
    - no offline. solution: **service workers**. also provide for background processing
    - real-time content: push messages. again, service worker
    - payment

- user experience
  - speed
  - responsiveness
  - storage - service workers
  - system integration - maybe handled through bookmarking

- developer experience
  - better base primitives
  - powerful application frameworks
  - modern layout techniques
  - more hardware access, e.g., geofencing
